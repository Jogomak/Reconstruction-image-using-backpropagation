# Reconstruction-image-using-backpropagation
Neural network using backpropagation to reconstruct image - Qt 5.11.2

At first start variable new_weights must be set to 1, and learning_rounds to any positive int (eq 5000). 
Later u can use earlier computed weight just by setting new_weights = 0.
In folder "weights" can be found weight which reconstruct sample image close perfectly
